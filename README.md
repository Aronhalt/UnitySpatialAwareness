Hey so I noticed what was wrong. It was the Inventory file attached to the player, it's not working correctly right now and throws a bunch of errors. To fix it the file needs to be removed from the player and the script removed from the project before it'll work. I don't know if you can flag scripts to not be compiled or not.
