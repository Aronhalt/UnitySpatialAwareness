UnitySpatialAwareness
=====================

Spatial Awareness group

So I've started adding issues to the issues bar on the side. As you do work here and there throw issues, enhancement ideas etc into the issues bar so that we can collaborate together on things that need to be done. This way it'll make our lives easier.

I've also added the Vista scene to the game. Take a look around and mess with it a bit. Our goal is to get it connected to the game in the future.
