1. Game state, set to the world. Checks whether in Stage 1 or Stage 2.
	In Stage 1, you will be free to move about the room. When the Stage starts the tutorial plays and the time is written down. After 2 minutes you (can?) leave the room.
	In Stage 2, "Special" items are made invisible and moved to your inventory. Objects can be chosen from your inventory, placed, and your confidence checked. When all 
	objects have been placed the game ends, all the data is print out to a .csv file.

2. Character state, set on the player. Checks whether placing or being asked for confidence. When an item has been placed, it needs to run the item's print out code and
   remove it from the inventory.
	Should only work in Stage 2!
